## Overview

- In criminal investigations, maintaining the integrity and traceability of digital evidence is crucial.
- Traditional evidence management systems are prone to tampering, data loss, and unauthorized access.
- Our project implements a *Blockchain-Based Digital Evidence Chain-of-Custody Tracker* using MultiChain to ensure the integrity, security, and transparency of digital evidence management.

## Features

- *Immutable Storage*: Stores evidence and chain-of-custody logs on MultiChain.
- *Decentralized Access*: Eliminates dependency on centralized cloud services.
- *Forensic Analysis Logs*: Records forensic summaries and extracted data.
- *Integrity Verification*: Ensures data authenticity via cryptographic hash comparisons.
- *IPFS Integration*: Provides decentralized storage for large digital evidence files.

## Tech Stack 

- Multichain
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- React.js + Tailwind CSS
- Flask
